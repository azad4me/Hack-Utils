## Description
This tool was thought to allow us to manage several programs or third party tools from the same interface in a fast and intuitive way.

To install the script:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/davidahid/Hack-Utils
cd Hack-Utils/scripts/
bash installer.sh
```

To use netutils you must run it as root.
```
sudo hackutils
```

## Top tools

* First of all, you can download all the necessary programs with the ***chckdep*** option (except a couple of programs that must be installed manually).

* We can use the ***anon*** option to anonymize ourselves usin anonsurf to connect to the TOR network, change our MAC or connect to NordVPN servers (account licensed required in NordVPN).

* With the ***malware*** option we can check with the hash of a virus if it is malicious or not and how is acting.

* We can manage various ovpn profiles to connect us to different OpenVPN servers with ***ovpn*** (in this case I only have one profile)

* Never get information about your own IP was so easy!!

* Sniff packets in the terminal an apply filters to sniff only what you want to sniff.

* I personally love this option - check out the broadband speed provided by our ISP! ( Only 30 Mbps? I thought I had 100 Mbps contracted :/ )
